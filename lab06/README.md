# Lab 6: Python Data Types and Basic Operations


## Objective
The purpose of this laboratory work is to practice working with Python built-in data types.
The lab focuses on user input, type identification, type conversion, dictionaries, and set operations.
These concepts are fundamental for understanding how data is handled in Python programs.

## Tasks
```
1. Take user input for an integer, a float, and a string and print their data types.
2. Convert a string value to an integer and then to a floating-point number.
3. Create a dictionary containing personal details (name and age) and access its values.
4. Perform basic set operations:
   - Add an element to a set
   - Remove an element from a set
   - Check if an element exists in the set
```

## Implementation
All tasks are implemented in the `lab6.py` file located in the `code` folder.
The program uses Python built-in functions such as `input()`, `type()`, and data structures
including dictionaries and sets.

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `code` directory:
```
   cd lab6/code
