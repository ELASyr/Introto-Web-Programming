Intro to Web Programming – Laboratory Repository

Student- Elaman Abdulloev ID11421



This repository contains all laboratory assignments completed for the Intro to Web Programming course. The purpose of this repository is to document practical progress in web development, starting from fundamental HTML structure and advancing toward interactive and data-driven web applications. Each lab represents a step in building technical knowledge and hands-on experience with modern web technologies. Across the labs, core concepts such as semantic HTML, CSS styling, responsive layout techniques, JavaScript logic, and basic database operations are explored and applied. The work demonstrates structured development practices, clear file organization, and continuous improvement in coding standards and problem-solving approaches.



Learning Outcomes

* Develop a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build structured, responsive, and interactive web applications.
* Design and implement server-side functionality using technologies such as Python (Django/Flask), Node.js, or PHP, enabling effective client–server communication.
* Apply modern front-end frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js to create dynamic and component-based user interfaces.
* Implement responsive design principles, web accessibility standards (WCAG), and SEO best practices to ensure usability and reach.
* Design, build, and integrate RESTful APIs or GraphQL services to connect web applications with databases and external systems.
* Apply foundational web security concepts, including protection against SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
* Use version control systems such as Git to manage source code and collaborate effectively in team environments.
